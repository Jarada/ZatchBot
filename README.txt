This is the respository for Zatch, an IRC bot I made. Also it needs the Pircbot api to work.

Branches:
- Voting: Where the voting is, if you want to work on Zatch's Voting Ability then you want this one

- Master: This is the master branch, if I deem something stable I'll bring it here

- Experimental: This is where I'm trying to break Zatch and try out new things, This will have all features not in Master

- Any Other Branch: If it has a name not on here I'm working on a new feature, the feature will also be in experimental.
